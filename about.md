I used to blog about trivial stuff on [sealedabstract](http://sealedabstract.com).  (Un)fortunately, that blog is now too popular to throw up a trivial paragraph here and there on some bug in SSH I found or whatever.

This place is my low-effort, low-quality place to document things that need to be documented somewhere.

Want me to build your app / consult for your company / speak at your event?  Good news!  I made a [whole website](http://drewcrawfordapps.com) just for you.
