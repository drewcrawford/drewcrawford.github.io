I'm a big believer in self-hosting, and I self-host many open source projects I work on.  It is important that hackers don't let the future of software development be controlled by one company, no matter how cool that company might be this week.

I am pretty laid back about merging random PRs and that sort of thing.  Make sure to read the notes in CONTRIBUTING, if there are any.
