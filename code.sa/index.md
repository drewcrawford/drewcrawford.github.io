I'm a big believer in self-hosting, and I self-host many open source projects I work on.  It is important that hackers don't let the future of software development be controlled by one company, no matter how cool that company might be this week.

I am pretty laid back about merging random PRs and that sort of thing.  Make sure to read the notes in CONTRIBUTING, if there are any.

Here are some public projects I self-host:

* [NaOH](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/NaOH): opinionated Swift bindings for libsodium
* [CLIKit](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/CLIKit): an advanced, intuitive command-line parsing library for Swift programs.
* [FISA](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/FISA): a multi-user secure wallet for secrets, passwords, tokens, and more, allowing you to share secrets among team members, access them from unit tests, and check them into source control.  
* [CaveJohnson](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/CaveJohnson2): a powerful and elegant build system to teach Xcode Server new tricks. It's a set of commands that perform various commonly-used tasks in an iOS/Mac continuous integration system. 
* [SynchronousRequestKit](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/SynchronousRequestKit): A synchronous REST library
* [DCADispatchAdditions](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/DCADispatchAdditions): additions for libdispatch
* [swift-linux](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/swift-linux): Minimal docker images for Swift
