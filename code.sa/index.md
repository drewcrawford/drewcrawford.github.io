I'm a big believer in self-hosting, and I self-host many open source projects I work on.  It is important that hackers don't let the future of software development be controlled by one company, no matter how cool that company might be this week.

I am pretty laid back about merging random PRs and that sort of thing.  Make sure to read the notes in CONTRIBUTING, if there are any.

Here are some public projects I self-host:

* [NaOH](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/NaOH): opinionated Swift bindings for libsodium
* [CLIKit](https://code.sealedabstract.com/drewcrawford/CLIKit): an advanced, intuitive command-line parsing library for Swift programs.
